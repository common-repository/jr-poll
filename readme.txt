== Description ==

This poll plugin allows you to display a poll on your blog as a widget!

The plugin stores the data for each poll you've created until you've deleted them. When you want to stop a poll being displayed, simply enable another poll - You can still see all of the data from the poll!

Now in version 2.1.0 is the ability to have 8 options instead of 4!

It's very simple to configure too - Just add a poll or two and then enable the widget!

== Installation ==

1. Upload `jr_poll.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Edit the JR Poll Settings in your Administration Panel
4. Enable the Widget through the Appearance --> Widgets tab.
